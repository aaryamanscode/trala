# Trala

Trala is a web browser optimized for vocal and voice browsing. For visually impaired or hands-free web users, Trala is the new way to surf the web. Trala’s machine learning algorithms analyze the visual structure of websites and converts it into a conversational user interface. 

Trala’s engine tags all visual elements of a website including images, text layout, and aesthetics, and translates them into a verbal or sonic equivalent. These elements are restructured within the conversational UI so that the structural informational design of the page remains intact—even if websites are not built to be accessible. Trala also optimizes your browsing experience by learning contextually-relevant frequently performed actions on websites and prioritizing them in its UI.

Trala uses these tags to construct a conversational user interface so that the content can be easily browsed through voice without information loss or overload. 

Trala comes with built in developer tools so that web developers can easily convert conventional websites into and beautiful sites compatible with conversational browsing. Trala also uses these optimizations by developers for their individual pages to improve its learning models and offer a better consumer-side experience for every website.
